// Bubble sort Algorithm using Red Black Tree
// A red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree
// Each node of the binary tree has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color of the node
// These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions
